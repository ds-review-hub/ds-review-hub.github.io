This site contains created and curated resources and review notebooks to support you on your journey through Codeup's Data Science program and beyond. This site will grow with you throughout the course, so bookmark it and keep it handy for support!

I highly suggest making your own Github Page as a portfolio that shows off your own work throughout the program. It would be a great link to share on your LinkedIn and drop on your resume for potential employers to check out!
