# Welcome to the Data Science Review Hub

This site contains created and curated resources and review notebooks to support you on your journey through Codeup's Data Science program and beyond. 

I highly suggest making your own Github Page as a portfolio that shows off your own work throughout the program. It would be a great link to share on your LinkedIn and drop on your resume for potential employers to check out!
